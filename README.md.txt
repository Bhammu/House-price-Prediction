# House Price Prediction

This project predicts house prices using a simple machine learning model and provides an interactive Streamlit web application.  
Users can upload their own datasets, train a regression model, and make predictions through a web interface.



## Project Overview

The Streamlit app automatically handles:
- Uploading a CSV dataset
- Detecting numeric and categorical columns
- Training a regression model (Linear Regression)
- Generating a form for prediction with smart numeric ranges
- Removing unnecessary ID or serial columns
- Producing live predictions after model training
